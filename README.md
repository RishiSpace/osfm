# osfm-control
A program that's capable of remotely controlling multiple computers with support for WIndows And Linux


## Software Description
### This project aims to create a software that lets users remote into multiple remote Linux systems at the highest quality their monitor supports. This makes use of the RDP protocol to allow users to remote into the Linux systems. The software will also allow users to remote into the Windows systems using the RDP protocol. This is done by using the GPU's Encoder (AMD,NVIDIA,INTEL) to encode the video stream and send it over a local network for the reciever to control at the highest quality possible. The reciever will then use the GPU's Decoder to decode the video stream and display it on the monitor. This allows the user to remote into the Linux systems at the highest quality their monitor supports. The software will also allow users to remote into the Windows systems using the RDP protocol. This is done by using the GPU's Encoder (AMD,NVIDIA,INTEL) to encode the video stream and send it over a local network for the reciever to control at the highest quality possible.
